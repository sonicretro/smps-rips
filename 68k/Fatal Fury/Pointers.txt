There are additional DAC lists for voices at Z80 Offset 9486 in the banks 168000, 170000 and 178000.


DAC List Format: (all Little Endian)
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Offset, relative)
          Note: The drums are relative to Z80 Offset 0000. (i.e. absolute)
                The voices are relative to their table offset, 9486.
2 bytes - Data Length
7 bytes - all 00
1 byte  - pitch

This is quite similar to Magical Taruruuto-Kun, but lacks the Pan Register setting.

See The Revenge of Shinobi for information about the unused bytes.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 001E)


The SMPS engine sends the DAC sounds 81-84 untranslated to the DAC driver, 88-8B get translated to 85.
But because the pitch byte is written to Z80 RAM 0374, instead of 01BA, the pitch of the drum doesn't change.


Before playing a voice, the Z80 Bank address is written to 1FFA-1FFB. The offset of the DAC table is stored at 1FF8-1FF9.

The IDs of the voices start with 07. That's because IDs 01-06 are occupied by the DAC drums.

Note: The DAC drums' ID has bit 7 set, while the voices' ID don't. I assume this is the "can be overridden" flag.
