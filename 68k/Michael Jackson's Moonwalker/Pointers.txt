DAC Table
---------
The DAC table format is the same as Fatal Fury.

Data is DPCM compressed.
Rev 00/01 drums use the usual delta-array:
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 001A)

Rev 00/01 voices and all sounds in prototype 1990-04-20 use a slightly modified array:
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FD FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 002A Rev 00/01, offset 0019 proto 1990-04-20)


Notes:
- Song 14 uses the data from Song 08.
- Like Sonic 1, Flag F4 disables modulation and F1 enables it.
- It uses the SMPS Z80-style Note-Rest-Duration-Duration behaviour. (i.e. the second "Duration" plays the previous note)
- The Note Fill value is stored unmodified, like in S1.
- The FA flag sets the Tick Multiplier.
- Song 0B has the same pointer as song 07.
- The code that handles the DAC is located at 06296.
- Special DAC sounds:
  DAC sounds 88-8F (bit 3 set) play sound 85 at 8 different rates (see rate data at 0602FA)
  DAC sounds 90-97 (bit 4 set) play sound 82 at rate 1E (sound 90) or 16 (others)
  Both command type change the playback rate value of the respective sounds, so they affect the frequency of 82 and 85.
  The songs use 90 and 91 to set up the default pitch of the snare and use 82 for the rest of the song.
- The PSG Volume Envelope control bytes are a bit different:
	80 - reset envelope
	83 - hold envelope
	85 xx - jump to envelope index xx
- The Dance Attack song list is at 00F420 (Rev 00) / 00F5E4 (Rev 01) / 00AE40 (proto 1990-04-20). The list is:
	8C 8D 8E - Round 1
	8F 90 91 - Round 2
	95 96 97 - Round 3
	92 93 94 - Round 4
	8C 91 96 - Round 5
	96       - Round 6
	92 93 94 - Round 4 (inside of a Cavern)
- for Round A-B, the modifiers at are DE40 (A) and DE5A (B) (both 2-byte words in 68k RAM)
- The RefreshFMVolume routine ignores the TL levels of the Output Operators completely. (i.e. the instrument's TL isn't added to the track volume)
  This behaviour is in Battle Golfer Yui, too.
- The sound driver of the 1990-04-20 prototype seems to be a mostly unmodified SMPS 68k/Type 1a. It mostly matches the one from Battle Golfer Yui.
- The DAC drums of the 1990-04-20 proto exactly match Battle Golfer Yui.
- b03 Thriller is a small bonus. Cris asked me to fix the drums of the song from the prototype so that it sounds okay in the final version.
  I went ahead and investigated how the drums were changed in other songs.
  Based on that I patched the song in a way similar to the original developers, so this version should be very close to what you would've heard, if the song made it into the final game.
  
  On the way I made a few interesting discoveries:
  - The Dance Attack version of the Thriller song that were present in Rev 00 were exactly as they were in the prototype - except for the drum track being different.
  - The drum track was patched in a quite interesting way:
    They put a "FA 01" command at the beginning that changes the track's tick multiplier to 1. (The song header has it set to 2.)
    They then rewrote the drum track from scratch.
  - In an attempt to make a faithful "final" version of the Thriller song, I searched for the byte sequence that is Thriller's main drum loop in all prototype songs. And as it turns out, this drum loop is also present in the song "Beat It".
    Thus I could just use the drum loop of the final version of "Beat It" in order to make a version of "Thriller" as if the song wasn't replaced.
