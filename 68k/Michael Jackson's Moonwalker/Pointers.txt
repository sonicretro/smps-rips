DAC Table
---------
The DAC table format is the same as Fatal Fury.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 001A)


Notes:
- Song 14 uses the data from Song 08.
- Like Sonic 1, Flag F4 disables modulation and F1 enables it.
- It uses the S3K-style Note-Rest-Duration-Duration way.
- The Note Fill value is stores unmodified, like in S1.
- The FA flag sets the Tick Multiplier.
- Song 0B has the same pointer as song 07.
- The code that handles the DAC is located at 06296.
- Special DAC sounds:
  DAC sounds 88-8F (bit 3 set) play sound 85 at 8 different rates (see rate data at 0602FA)
  DAC sounds 90-97 (bit 4 set) play sound 82 at rate 1E (sound 90) or 16 (others)
  Both command type change the playback rate value of the respective sounds, so they affect the frequency of 82 and 85.
  The songs use 90 and 91 to set up the default pitch of the snare and use 82 for the rest of the song.
- The PSG Volume Envelope control bytes are a bit different:
	80 - reset envelope
	83 - hold envelope
	85 xx - jump to envelope index xx
- The Dance Attack song list is at 00F420 (Rev 00) / 00F5E4 (Rev 01). The list is:
	8C 8D 8E - Round 1
	8F 90 91 - Round 2
	95 96 97 - Round 3
	92 93 94 - Round 4
	8C 91 96 - Round 5
	96       - Round 6
	92 93 94 - Round 4 (inside of a Cavern)
- for Round A-B, the modifiers at are DE40 (A) and DE5A (B) (both 2-byte words in 68k RAM)
- The RefreshFMVolume routine ignores the TL levels of the Output Operators completely. (i.e. the instrument's TL isn't added to the track volume)
  This behaviour is in Battle Golfer Yui, too.
