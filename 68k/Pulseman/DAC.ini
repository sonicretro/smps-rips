; Sounds A4-AB are actually invalid. Their offsets actually point to Z80 RAM.
; The sample definitions are duplicates from some of the in-ROM-bank tables.
; If the ROM bank bit would be set for the offset, most of them would play properly, although with a wrong speed.
; The bank value for A4-A8 is correct, for A9-AB it is 06, although it should be 0E or 0F as seen below.
