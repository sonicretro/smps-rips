DAC Channel Notes:

Coord. Flag EE dd [Z80 Mem 1F00] selects the DAC sound to play. (01 is the first sound)
The actual note sets the DAC frequency.
It's also possible to play the sounds backwards by using Coord. Flag FA mm. [Z80 Mem 1F06] (00 - forward, 01 - backward)
Coord. Flag E3 ee [Z80 Mem 1F01] enables DAC volume control. 01 - disable, FF - enable, 00 - disable DAC
	(Since the driver only checks for zero, negative and positive, 02-7F are equal to 01 and 80-FE are equal to FF.)
Coord. Flag FC vv [Z80 Mem 1F03] sets the DAC volume (if enabled), which is 00 (min) to 10 (max, default).
	-> The driver performs a correct multiplication of (sample * volume / 10h).

Coord. Flag ?? vv [Z80 Mem 1F05] makes it possible to loop the sound. (00 - off, 01 - on)

DAC Sounds are stored uncompressed in ROM Banks 0xE0000-0xF8000.
The DAC Sound Table is located at the beginning of each bank.
Each entry consists of two 16-bit values in Z80 (Little Endian) byte order:
- Z80 Start Offset
- Data Length
- Z80 Start Offset (again)
- Data Length (again)

Bank Offset	Entries
0xE0000		0Ah
0xE8000		02h
0xF0000		04h
0xF8000		01h
-> 11h sounds.

There is a lookup-table for Sound ID -> Sound+Bank at offset 0500 in Z80 RAM.
The format is:
1 byte - Z80 Bank ID (00 - E0000, 01 - E8000, 02 - F0000, 03 - F8000)
1 byte - sound number in bank (table offset is sound number * 8)



DAC Frequencies:
The driver uses a look-up table to of jump offsets, which is located at offset 0170.
It jumps into a section of NOPs, which cause a delay between the DAC commands.
The next actual code is at offset 0314.

There are 1Dh entries in the table, that so the only valid frequencies are 81-9D.
The resulting DAC sample rate ranges from 2000 Hz (81) to 10300 Hz (9D) in approximate half-tone steps.
