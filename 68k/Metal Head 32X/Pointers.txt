DAC Table
---------
1 byte  - Z80 Bank
2 bytes - Data Start
2 bytes - Data Length

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.

Notes:
- You need to subtract 880000 from all pointers (including Z80 Bank Offset) to get the actual ROM offsets.
- Unlike other SMPS 68k drivers in 32X games, the PSG frequency table has the usual number of frequencies.
- All sound data (from 048000 on) matches exactly, except for two F4 xx commands in one of the songs.
- The sound driver is able to use PWM tracks. This assumes that, similar to Chaotix, the SMPS files have 4 additional track headers following the PSG headers.
  That mode is never enabled though and none of the songs has the necessary header fields.
- The SMPS driver has normal SFX removed. Instead it is possible to play SFX data using the YM2612's Special FM 3 mode.
  The game can turn operators on/off by request and change the volume, frequency and freq. multiplicator settings.
