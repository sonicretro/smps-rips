It also matches with the Sonic 2 Nick Arcade Beta.

Notes:
- The PSG Volume Envelope control bytes are a bit different:
	80 - hold envelope
- The snare sound is from the Roland TR-626 and plays with 23784 Hz (or 16845 Hz with Generic SMPS 68k DAC driver).
  The to get the original pitch, the sample must be played with 14420 Hz.
- The bass drum plays with 8201 Hz. (7181 Hz with Gen. SMPS 68k)
- The SEGA sound is stored as raw PCM and its offset and length are hardcoded into the DAC driver.

Prototype notes:
- The sound driver is still very similar to the SMPS 68k Type 1b driver used by Golden Axe II.
  A few modifications were already done:
  - 1-up fade-in is supported (still with lots of audio artifacts, though)
  - The code for ring and block pushing SFX are there, as is the sequence command to stop the FM4 channel.
  - It halts the Z80 while doing any sound processing, just like in the final version. (Vanilla SMPS 68k suspends the Z80 only while doing FM writes.)
  However, they didn't start stripping features yet, so the SMPS sequences are mostly compatible with Golden Axe II.
  PSG volume envelopes are also using the common control bytes for SMPS 68k Type 1.
- The DAC driver is still the generic SMPS 68k DAC driver. A few modifications were made though, so it isn't a binary match.
  The DAC driver used by the final version of Sonic 1 is faster than the DAC driver used in the proto and most other SMPS 68k games.
  But since the game developers only adjusted the speed of the bass drum, most DAC sample are higher-pitched in the final version.
  The samples themselves were not changed.
- This is the only SMPS 68k Type 1 driver known to have the global Modulation Data array filled in...
  ... and it even makes use of it! (e.g. in Green Hill Zone)
