DAC Table
---------
The DAC table format is the same as Fatal Fury.

There are two delta-array.
pre-SMPS delta-array: (used for DAC sounds 82+)
01 03 06 0C 18 28 50 90 FF FD FA F4 E8 D8 B0 70 (Z80 Driver offset 017E)

usual SMPS delta-array: (used for DAC sounds 81)
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 018E)

The delta-array for the current sound is copied to offset 001E when loading the sound.


Notes:
- The sound driver matches exactly for Vol 2 and Vol 3, except for absolute pointers, which are 02xxxx in Vol 2 and 1Axxxx in Vol 3.
  There are also some minor fixes to the song and SFX in Vol 3.
- Even though the game runs in PAL mode, the UpdateSound routine is only called 5 out of 6 frames. (see code at 001440 in Vol 2)
  So the driver runs at an effective rate of 41.67 Hz.
  Probably whoever ported the music took the NTSC tempo and ported it to PAL, so in order to get the original PAL speed, the sound driver is updated less often.
- The only DAC SFX sound (ID 89) doesn't work properly, because the DAC driver uses the wrong delta-array. (preSMPS array is used, normal SMPS array should be used)
- In Vol 2, the song uses invalid FM instruments about 2 minutes into the song. This got fixed in Vol 3.
- The song playing in the menu is a port of "Game BGM 1" from World Championship Soccer/World Cup Italia '90.
  The menu in MegaGames 3in1 Vol 1 played the original song using the preSMPS 68k sound driver from the included World Cup Italia '90.
