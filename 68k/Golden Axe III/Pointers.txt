DAC Table
---------
DAC List Format: (all little endian values)
2 bytes - Data Length
1 byte  - Pitch
2 bytes - Start Offset (relative to entry offset)
-> 5 bytes

The DAC pitch calculation is different compared to other SMPS drivers.
Every loop, the pitch value gets added to a counter. On overflow, a sample is processed.
So high pitch values mean a high frequency.

The DAC driver also is able to do 2-channel mixing.


Notes:
- Song 0E uses the data of song 01.
- The DAC driver knows 3 "channels".
  SMPS notes 81-90 get sent to BGM channel 1. (Z80 RAM 1FFC/FD)
  SMPS notes 91-A0 get sent to BGM channel 2. (Z80 RAM 1FFE/FF)
  SMPS notes A1-B0 get sent to both BGM channels. (and so they are twice as loud)
  DAC SFX get sent to their own channel and overridde BGM channel 2. (Z80 RAM 1FFA/B)
  
  The DAC driver ANDs BGM sounds with 0F before playing them, so 81 = 91 = A1.
  This isn't done with SFX sounds, because there are valid SFX sounds from 88 to 92.
- The Sound Test -> Sound ID list locations are:
    BGM:   0154A4 (JE)
    SE:    0154BE (JE)
- The Sound RAM begins at C000. (68k RAM)
- There are a few special coordination flags. There is also a special DAC mode, where it reads 2 notes (one for each channel)
  E5 - set DAC channel to 2-note mode (temporarily, disabled after the reading the note)
  E9 - set DAC channel to 2-note mode (permanently)
  ED - turn DAC channel's to 2-note mode off
  EE vv oo oo - Conditional Jump (condition is true when vv == SndRAM+0Eh)
  F1 - sets TrkRAM+08h = SndRAM+32h
  F4 - sets SndRAM+32h = TrkRAM+08h and adds a random value to TrkRAM+08h (The random value can be 01..0F or F0.)
  FF 01 xx [xx] - pauses and resumes music, but seems to be able to fade it in/out, too
- SFX CD (sound test SE 45) uses command F1/F4
- Music 99 (sound test BGM 24) uses command E9/ED
