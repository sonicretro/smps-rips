There are additional DAC lists at the start of banks 040000, 048000, 050000 and 058000.


DAC List Format:
see Magical Taruruuto-Kun


Notes:
- The main drums don't use banks.
- All banks have x unused entries, where x is the number of entries in the previous bank. (the first bank has no unused entries, of course)
- Song 04 was originally supposed to loop. Each F2 (Track End) command is followed by 2 bytes representing a pointer.
  In 04 Happy Ending_looping.tra, all F2 commands were replaced by F6 (GoTo) to give you an idea how it was supposed to be. (minus the transpose bug in the melody, of course)
