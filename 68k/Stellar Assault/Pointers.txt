DAC Table
---------
The DAC table format is the same as Metal Head 32X.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 01CD)


Notes:
- The Pan Animation effect was removed.
- You need to subtract 900000 from all pointers (including Z80 Bank Offset) to get the actual ROM offsets.
- The DAC driver seems to be the same as used in Metal Head 32X, but without Volume Control.
- All sound data (from 0C0000 on) matches exactly in the UE and J versions.
- Tempo Algorithm:
    Tempo #1
	Tempo 00..7F
	    Tempo Counter += Tempo, Delay on Overflow
	Tempo 80..FF
	    no delay
    UpdateAll
    Tempo #2
	Tempo 00..7F
	    continue
	Tempo 80..FF
	    Tempo Counter += Tempo, UpdateAll again if not overflowed

  Summarized:
    Tempo 00..7F
	-> Delay on Overflow
    Tempo 80..FF
	-> update twice if not overflowed

- The game's music and sound is optimized for PAL mode. In NTSC mode, sound processing is skipped every 6th frame.
	if (NTSC Mode)
	{
		if (SndRAM[0] == 1)
		{
			SndRAM[0] = 6;
			return;
		}
		SndRAM[0] --;
	}
