PCM Table / PSG Drum Table:
see Mickey no Boku wa Meitantei


Notes:
- The sound driver differs a bit between the J and U versions.
  The U version matches Mickey no Boku wa Meitantei.
  The J version lacks some of the command flags.
  The fade settings are different in both versions as well.
- The music of the J version uses PCM drums. They were cut from the U version, probably due to space reasons.
- In order to fix the different PSG frequency arrays, all notes in the U version are one octave higher.
  The J version's frequency table beings with A3 instead of C4 though, so the notes in the U version still play 3 semitones higher.
- The U version has an additional song.
- The location names follow the US localization.
  Hoops = some Basketball game
  Concentration = Card Matching
  Egg Switch = Shell Game
