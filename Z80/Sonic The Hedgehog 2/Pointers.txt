The Simon Wai Beta is barely comparable with the later Betas.

0ED100-0FEEA0 matches between Beta 4 and Beta 5. (sound driver and SFX differences)
0ED100-0F015F and 0F1E8C-0FEEA2 matches between Beta 5 and Beta 6. (sound driver and SFX differences, missing art)
0EBCF0-0FFFFF matches between Beta 6 and 7.
0ED100-0F015F and 0F1E8C-0FFFFF matches between Beta 7 and Beta 8. (sound driver and art differences)
0ED100-0FFFFF matches between Beta 8 and Final. (sound driver differences)
The complete sound-related part (0EC000-0FFFFF) matches in Rev 00, 01 and 02.
042A9A-0FFFFF match byte-by-byte between Rev 01 and 02.


DAC Playlist Format:
1 byte  - DAC Note (81+)
1 byte  - Pitch

DAC Pointer Format:
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Bank Offset)
2 bytes - Data Length

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 01B3 W, 0179 Wai Beta, 01B3 Beta 4/8, 01B5 Beta 5/6)


Notes:
- The Bank List uses the following format:
	Bits 0-4 (1F): Song Pointer ID in the respective bank
	Bits  5  (20): Compression (00 - Saxman compressed, 20 - uncompressed)
	Bits  6  (40): disable PAL music speedup (for Drowning jingle)
	Bits  7  (80): ROM Bank (00 - 0F0000, 80 - 0F8000)
- Sonic 2 Final and Beta 4-8 use a different Tempo algorithm than the Simon Wai Beta.
  Sonic 2 Final: Tempo Counter += Tempo Increment, delay unless the addition overflows
  Sonic 2 Wai Beta: Tempo Counter -= 1, delay and reset when reaching 0 (same as Sonic 1)
- The GoodGen (W) version is Rev 01.
- Sound Driver versions:
	Simon Wai Beta (size: 0DF3 compr, 11AD uncomp)
	Beta 4 (size: 0F6B compr, 131A uncomp)
	Beta 5 (size: 0F5D compr, 12FB uncomp)
	Beta 6/7 (size: 0F61 compr, 12FF uncomp)
	Beta 8 (size: 0F61 compr, 1305 uncomp)
	Final (size: 0F64 compr, 1308 uncomp)
- The Nick Arcade Beta uses an unmodified Sonic 1 sound driver.
- PSG Envelope 0D differs between the Wai Beta and Beta 4-8/Final.
- All DAC sounds but 81, 82 and 85 were changed between the Wai Beta and Beta 4-8/Final.
- The Speed Shoe Tempos differ between Beta 4/5 and Beta 6-8/Final. The Tempos in the Wai Beta are the same ones as used in Sonic 1.
- Most work on the sound driver was done between the Simon Wai Beta and Beta 4, including the code that handles all the special SFX and the PAL speed fix.
- The code for handling the Push SFX from S1 was removed between Beta 4 and 5.
- The way of handling Game Pause was modified between Beta 7 and 8. All other modifications between Beta 5 and Final were minor.
