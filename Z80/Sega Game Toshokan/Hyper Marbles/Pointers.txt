There is only 1 music bank: 008000


Notes:
- The sound driver load routine is located at 020180. (executed from 68k RAM, address FF0180)
- For the SegaNet music and dumped driver, see the "Sega Game Toshokan" folder.
- The drums use Modulation data from the SegaNet offset list.
- The Modulation and PSG envelopes match excatly in both data sets.
- Z80 Data Struct format:
    2 bytes - Data Length - 1 (DBRA count)
    2 bytes - Z80 RAM offset
    2 bytes - ROM offset (lower word, high word is the same as the data struct offset)
- Data Set 1 contains the music + SFX.
  Data Set 2 contains music + SFX for title and credits screens.
- Song 1_04 Round Clear makes use of a bug in related to custom modulation (uninitialized IY register).
  The bug is present in all versions of SMPS Z80 Type 1 and was fixed in SMPS Z80 Type 2.
- The SegaNet routine that copies Sound IDs to the Z80 driver is at 003622.
  It waits for the value in FFA2 (68k RAM) to be 01+ and reads the Sound ID from 68k RAM at FF9A+(value-1).
  The SegaNet PlaySound routine is at 00360E and is referenced by the jump table entry at FC68 (68k RAM).
- The Game Mode is a 2-byte value stored at FFC0 (68k RAM). It must be a multiple of 4 and between 00 and 24.
- The Title Screen Mode is a 2-byte value stored at BE20 (68k RAM). It must be a multiple of 4 and between 00 and 10.
