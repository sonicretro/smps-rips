Notes:
- The sound driver load routine is located at 0212B0. (executed from 68k RAM, address FF12B0)
- For the SegaNet music and dumped driver, see the "Sega Game Toshokan" folder.
- Z80 Data Struct format:
    2 bytes - Data Length - 1 (DBRA count)
    2 bytes - Z80 RAM offset
    2 bytes - ROM offset (lower word, high word is the same as the data struct offset)
- The drums use Modulation data from the SegaNet offset list.
- The game patches the Z80 driver a bit.
  It prevents StopDrumPSG from muting the FM6 track and makes ApplyFading process 7 FM tracks (drum + FM 1-6) instead of 6.
  It also patches FM drum 85 (incl. FM drum instrument 01) and FM drum 88 (incl. FM drum instrument 03).
