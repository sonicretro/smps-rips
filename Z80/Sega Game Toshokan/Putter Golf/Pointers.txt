Notes:
- The sound driver load routine is located at 0219B8. (executed from 68k RAM, address FF19B8)
- For the SegaNet music and dumped driver, see the "Sega Game Toshokan" folder.
- Z80 Data Struct format:
    2 bytes - Data Length - 1 (DBRA count)
    2 bytes - Z80 RAM offset
    2 bytes - ROM offset (lower word, high word is the same as the data struct offset)
  Note: The data length seems incorrect. The length for Data #1 is off by one and the length for Data #2 is completely wrong.
- The drums use Modulation data from the SegaNet offset list.
- The SegaNet PlayMusic routine is at 0035E8 and is referenced by the jump table entry at FC62 (68k RAM).
  It writes the parameter instantly to Z80 RAM 1C09 and clears 1C04-1C07 with value 00.
- Various values (68k RAM):
	FFC0/C1 - Game Mode (00-1C in steps of 04, set to 10 to end the round)
	E4B8/B9 - current Round
	E4C0/C1 - some other Mode (00-0A in steps of 02)
	E4C4/C5 - "Par" value for current round
	E4C6/C7 - number of passed turns
	E4C8/C9 - shot difference (turns - par) during score tally
	E4CA/CB - remaining balls (finish round 18 with 8+ balls for bonus round)
	E4CC - direction of power bar
	E4CD - current "Power" value
	E4CE/CF - some other Mode (00-06 in steps of 01)
