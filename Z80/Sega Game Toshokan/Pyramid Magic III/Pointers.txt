Sound RAM:		1C00 (Z80 RAM)


Notes:
- The sound driver load routine is located at 0202B6. (executed from 68k RAM, address FF02B6)
- For the SegaNet music and dumped driver, see the "Sega Game Toshokan" folder.
- Z80 Data Struct format:
    2 bytes - Data Length - 1 (DBRA count)
    2 bytes - Z80 RAM offset
    2 bytes - ROM offset (lower word, high word is the same as the data struct offset)
  Note: The data length for Data #3 seems incorrect and copies a few garbage bytes.
- There is no modulation data. The drums are supposed to use Modulation data from the SegaNet offset list.
  But due to the ROM bank offset being wrong, that doesn't work either.
