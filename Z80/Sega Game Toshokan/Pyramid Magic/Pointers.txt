Sound RAM:		1C00 (Z80 RAM)


Notes:
- Also covers Pyramid Magic Special.
- The sound driver load routine is located at 020FE0. (executed from 68k RAM, address FF0FE0)
- For the SegaNet music and dumped driver, see the "Sega Game Toshokan" folder.
- Z80 Data Struct format:
    2 bytes - Data Length - 1 (DBRA count)
    2 bytes - Z80 RAM offset
    2 bytes - ROM offset (lower word, high word is the same as the data struct offset)
  Note: The data length seems incorrect in Pyramid Magic. The length for Data #1 is off by one and the length for Data #2 is completely wrong.
- There is no modulation data. The drums are supposed to use Modulation data from the SegaNet offset list.
  But due to the ROM bank offset being wrong, that doesn't work either.
