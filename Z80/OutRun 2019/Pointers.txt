Each one of the 2 music banks (070000 to 078000) contains redundant copies of some general data like PSG envelopes, pointers and DAC sounds.
The PSG envelope and frequency flutter data matches exactly, but the priority array differs.

All data between 020000 and 0FFFFF matches exactly between all verions (J, U, E and U Beta) of the ROM. This includes the sound related part of the ROM (070000-07FFFF).


DAC Table
---------
Z80 Banks with DAC sounds are 018000h and 020000h.
The format is the same one as used in Mazin Saga.


Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 007E)



Notes:
- The 68k tells the Z80 driver which bank it has to use by writing to Z80 RAM 1C00/1C01 (MSB/LSB).
		U Beta	J	U	E
  Code Address	0006B8	0006B8	0006D2	0006F0
  Bank Table	00070C	00070C	000726	000744
  The table consists of 2 bytes per entry (for Z80 RAM 1C00/1C01), MSB first.
- Although every SMPS has 6 FM/DAC and no PSG channels, the headers contain data for 07/03.
