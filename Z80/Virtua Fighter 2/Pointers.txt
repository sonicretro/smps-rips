SFX Pointers point to bank 3A8000 in the final and all 1996-09 betas.
In the 1996-08 betas they point to bank 398000.


DAC List Format: (all little endian values)
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Bank Offset)
2 bytes - Data Length
1 byte  - Bank (bits 22-15)
-> 5 bytes

This is the same format as used in OutRunners, except that OutRunners' Bank value is relative and this one is absolute.


Notes:
- The coordination flag handler is at 09E4, the cf. jump table at 09F4.
- The driver supports 2-channel DAC mixing incl. automatic bank switching.
  When no sound is playing on a DAC channel, data is read from an array at 0F7F that is filled with the null-sample value 80h.
  (The array is 10h bytes long, but it loops over the first 8 bytes only.)
- The Sound Test list has the format:
    0E bytes - Name
    01 byte  - Sound ID
  List locations:
    S.E. list:  006C72
    Voice list: 006D9E
    BGM list:   006FE8
- The songs 10-1C have the same headers as songs 01-0C (10/11 uses song header 01).
  The only difference is the slightly faster tempo.
- All songs use one shared instrument library that's stored after the last song in each of the two banks.
  The instrument library matches in both banks.
  Songs 01-09/11-19 use the first instrument library (at E7E6), songs 0A-0C/1A-1C use the second one (at FD2B).

Beta Notes:
- The 1996-08-19 beta has only 3 songs. They all use a different instrumentation than the final version.
- The sound driver + all of its data matches between the 1996-09-27 beta and the final.
- The final sound driver is almost the same as the one used in beta 1996-08-19.
  The only differences are:
	- different bank switch code and pointers for SMPS data (envelopes, songs, ...)
	- first Special SFX ID:
		08-19	09-13	09-27, final
		E7	E8	E9
	- The last valid song ID in the DoSoundQueue routine is 8E for the 1996-08 betas and 9F in the 1996-09 betas and the final.
- detailed history:
  Beta 08-19 -> 08-30
	PSG envelope 04 changed, songs added (same amount of song slots), DAC sounds changed
  Beta 08-30 -> 09-13
	sound data moved from 398000 to 3A8000, one SFX added, songs added (last song ID 8E->9F), DAC sounds changed [now final]
	Note: Most of the songs are already finished in this beta and match the ones in the final completely.
  Beta 09-13 -> 09-20
	songs changed
  Beta 09-20 -> 09-27/final
	PSG envelopes 05 and 06 changed, one SFX added, SFX changed
- Song 09 is the only song in the 08-30 beta that like in the final. (The tick timing was changed though.)
