Sound RAM:		1C00 (Z80 RAM)


DAC List Format: (all little endian values)
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Bank Offset)
2 bytes - Data Length
1 byte  - Bank (bits 22-15)
-> 5 bytes

This is the same format as used in OutRunners, except that OutRunners' Bank value is relative and this one is absolute.


Notes:
- The coordination flag handler is at 09E4, the cf. jump table at 09F4.
- The driver supports 2-channel DAC mixing incl. automatic bank switching.
  When no sound is playing on a DAC channel, data is read from an array at 0F7F that is filled with the null-sample value 80h.
  (The array is 10h bytes long, but it loops over the first 8 bytes only.)
- The Sound Test list has the format:
    0E bytes - Name
    01 byte  - Sound ID
  List locations:
    S.E. list:  006C72
    Voice list: 006D9E
    BGM list:   006FE8
- The songs 10-1C have the same headers as songs 01-0C (10/11 uses song header 01).
  The only difference is the slightly faster tempo.
- All songs use one shared instrument library that's stored after the last song in each of the two banks.
  The instrument library matches in both banks.
  Songs 01-09/11-19 use the first instrument library (at E7E6), songs 0A-0C/1A-1C use the second one (at FD2B).
