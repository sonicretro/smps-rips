DAC Table
---------
The format is the same one as used in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 11D5)


Notes:
- The driver has a few additional coordination flags that allow switching DAC banks, playing DAC sounds in "uninterruptable" mode and switching between DPCM and PCM mode.
  Although a few songs make use of the "set DPCM mode" flag, the PCM mode is never used, because none of the DAC sounds are uncompressed.
- This is the only SMPS Z80 Type 2 driver known to use the YM Timer for timing.
- Sound Test List: 0593CA
- Two songs use FM instrument commands with invalid values.
  04 Connected Here (Map Screen): instrument 74h (followed by a command that sets instrument 00h, so it's redundant)
  14 Gouketsuji March (Staff Roll): instrument 73h (right at the end)
  I included fixed versions of those songs. For song 04 I made it skip the redundant command, for song 14 I made it use instrument 00h.
