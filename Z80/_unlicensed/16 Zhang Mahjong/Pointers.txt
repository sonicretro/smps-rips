There is only 1 music bank: 078000


Both games, 16 Zhang Mahjong and Pretty Girl Mahjongg, use the exactly same sound data.
The only differences in the DAC and sound banks are due garbage that fills unused bytes.


DAC List Format: (all big endian values!)
2 bytes - Data Length
2 bytes - ignored (Data Length + this value seems to result in the full size of the data in ROM)
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Bank Offset)

The DAC data is raw uncompressed 8-bit data.



Notes:
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- The jump command in song 84's drum channel jumps to the wrong drum track.
  04o (original) is how it sounds in the game. 04f (fixed) is how it is supposed to sound.
- The sound driver is able to play DAC Voices via commands E4-EE.
  Their speed is fixed to a pitch value of 32h (value is at 10A1).
  Most other Gamtec games could play DAC Voices as well, but don't use that feature.
  They all probably just re-use this game's sound driver.
- There is an unreferenced DAC sound at 05A1F9.
  It sounds like it's part of the DAC sound that follows it. Both sounds are separated by a 00 byte though,
  so dividing both DAC sounds seems intentional.
- [16 Tiles] PlaySound routine: 036828 (reads sound ID from 68k RAM 0546)
- [Pretty Girl] PlaySound routine: 03B3EA (reads sound ID from 68k RAM 0586)
- The songs are used at different places in both games, but the 3 unused songs are not referenced by either game.
  Looking at the code, these songs are used at the same spot:
	16T	PG
	06	02	Main BGM
	01	01
	09	04
	02	04
	04	06
	06	09	Title Screen
	02	02
	06	06
	07	07	Game Over
