DAC List Format: (all big endian values!)
2 bytes - Data Length
2 bytes - Padding bytes? (ignored)
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Bank Offset)

The DAC data is raw uncompressed 8-bit data.



Notes:
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- The jump command in song 84's drum channel jumps to the wrong drum track.
  04o (original) is how it sounds in the game. 04f (fixed) is how it is supposed to sound.
- The sound driver is able to play DAC Voices via commands E4-EE.
  Their speed is fixed to a pitch value of 32h (value is at 10A1).
  Most other Gamtec games could play DAC Voices as well, but don't use that feature.
  They all probably just re-use this game's sound driver.
- There is an unreferenced DAC sound at 05A1F9.
  It sounds like it's part of the DAC sound that follows it. Both sounds are separated by a 00 byte though,
  so dividing both DAC sounds seems intentional.
