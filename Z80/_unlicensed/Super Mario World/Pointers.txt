Notes:
- This is a modification of Squirrel King. All sound data but the music matches exactly.
  The songs from Squirrel King match except for different pointers due to shifted data.
  The instrument library got a few additional instruments.
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- There is an unreferenced FM instrument at C706, because all songs have the instrument pointer set to C71F.
- Level Song List:
    World 1 - 09 Mario World
    World 2 - 09 Mario World
    World 3 - 03 Forest Adventure
    World 4 - 05 Street Cruise
    World 5 - 04 Grotto Visit
    World 6 - 06 Graveyard Encounter
    World 7 - 03 Forest Adventure (part 1) / 04 Grotto Visit (part 2) / 05 Street Cruise (part 3)
- The garbage instrument from Squirrel King is present in here, too. But due to the new instruments, it's in the middle of the library now.
