Notes:
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- Like many other Gamtec games, the sound driver is able to play DAC sounds and the game doesn't use them.
  Unlike those games though, the data is DPCM compressed and the DAC table format is different.
  The driver is reused in Thunderbolt II and there it actually uses DAC sounds.
- PlaySound routine: 00EFC0 (reads sound ID from 68k RAM 0018)
- current round BGM: 0396 (68k RAM)
