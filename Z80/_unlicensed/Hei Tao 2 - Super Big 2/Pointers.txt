Notes:
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- PlaySound routine: 0084C6 (reads sound ID from 68k RAM 813C)
- current Music Set ID: 80EA (68k RAM)
- Music Set ID list: 00951A
- Main BGM play routine: 00099A (no table, but CMP/BNE)
- Ending routine: 000EFE
- Game Over routine: 11C8
- The sound driver is very similar to 777 Casino and has the same DAC sample routines.
  The copy-protection code is also present, but is a bit more complex.
  It's initialized by song 83 (Match Lost) and checked by song 84 (Match Won).
  When playing song 84 the 8th time, it writes 1 byte each to 4 different locations in 68k RAM. (in order to trigger the ending?)
  Then it checks the copy protection byte at 1BF9 and if it is wrong, it clears 68k RAM 8000-8FFF, crashing the game.
- Some of the songs are also used in Super Big 2 for the SNES.
  Title Screen (MD) - Card Game 1 (SNES)
  Main BGM 1 (MD) - Unused Song 1 (SNES)
  Main BGM 4 (MD) - Matching Cards (SNES)
