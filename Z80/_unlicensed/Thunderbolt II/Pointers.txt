DAC List Format: (all big endian values!)
2 bytes - Data Length
2 bytes - Pitch (high byte ignored, low byte copied to 1BFE)
2 bytes - ROM Start Offset (high 2 bytes ignored, low 2 bytes treated as Z80 Bank Offset)

Data is DPCM compressed with the pre-SMPS delta-array.
01 03 06 0C 18 28 50 90 FF FD FA F4 E8 D8 B0 70 (Z80 Driver offset 1101)


Notes:
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
  It is the exactly same version as used by Chao Ji Da Fu Weng and thus supports DPCM compressed DAC samples.
  This is one of the few Taiwanese SMPS-based games to actually make use of DAC samples!
- The copy protection reads words from offset 400000/400006 and copies them to 68k RAM 0082/007E. The values are later checked by reading the RAM copies.
- PlaySound routine: 057660 (reads sound ID from 68k RAM 0018)
- Stage BGM List: 001CEE
- current stage: 0026 (68k RAM)
- next stage routine: 006ABC
- Ending routine: 0054D2
- Like Huan Le Tao Qi Shu: Smart Mouse, all of the songs have track headers for 6xDrum/FM, but the Stage songs have the track count set to 4.
  The full versions of these songs are included as files that begin with an "a".
