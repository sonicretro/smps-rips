Notes:
- The boss theme modifies the driver update rate, but none of the other songs do.
  So the boss theme causes all other songs to play at a higher speed.
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- Like many other Gamtec games, the sound driver is able to play DAC sounds and the game doesn't use them.
  Unlike those games though, the data is DPCM compressed and the DAC table format is different.
