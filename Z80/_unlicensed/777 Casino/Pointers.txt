There is only 1 music bank: 0F8000


Notes:
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- The sound driver was patched to execute additional code when starting song 81 and 83.
  This code does some things related to copy-protection.
  
  1. Song 83 (Intro Song) switches temporarily to bank 400000, then adds the values at 8000/2/4/6 to the values at
  Z80 RAM 1151/2/3/4 and writes the result to 1BF9/A/B/C.
  Finally, 1BF8 is initialized with 20h.
  
  2. Song 81 (Town Theme) checks 1BF8. If the value is 00, the copy-protection code is skipped.
  Else the value at 1BF8 is incremented by 1. If it still is smaller than 23h, the copy-protection code is also skipped.
  After the 3rd time, the copy-protection code runs and checks 1BF9. A value of 65h or 73h is valid.
  In all other cases, the Z80 driver switches to bank FF0000 and writes FF to E000-E1FE.
  This overwrites 68k RAM at 6000-61FE and makes the player unable to move.
