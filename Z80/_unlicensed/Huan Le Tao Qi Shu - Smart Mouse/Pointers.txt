Notes:
- The sound driver originates from Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair.
- PlaySound routine: 009C5A (reads sound ID from 68k RAM 10DA)
- Stage BGM Sound ID List: 000996 (2 bytes per entry)
- current Stage ID: 1040 (68k RAM)
- Next Level routine: 000A80
- All of the songs have track headers for 6xDrum/FM (no PSG headers), but except for Stage Intro/Clear, all songs have the Drum/FM count set to 4.
  Some of the songs have the remaining tracks just point to a "Track End" command, others make use of those additional tracks. The full versions of the latter ones are included as files that begin with an "a".
  The additional tracks often are broken though and go out-of-sync with the rest of the song.
