BaseRate = 210561
RateDiv = 25.18

; The game has the background noise (channel 1) always enabled,
; so I assume ch1 + ch2 playing.
; In Rev 00, the driver itself locks the DAC Rate to 2,
; resulting in a constant sample rate of 7748 Hz.
; Rev 03/Perfect Edition uses DAC Rate 1, resulting in a sample rate of 8044 Hz.
