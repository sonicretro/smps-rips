The sound-related part of the ROM (0B0000-0FFFFF) matches exactly in Rev 03 and Perfect Edition.
Rev 00 and Rev 03 have a few differences regarding the DAC driver.


DAC List Format: (Z80 Sound Driver)
The format is the same one as used in Mazin Saga.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 0F48)


DAC List Format: (Z80 DAC Drivers)

- The driver is SMPS Z80 Type 2/FM, but has still the FM3 frequencies from Type 1 drivers.
  It also is the only Type 2 driver that sets 1C00/01 to the current ROM bank. (The value is never read back though.)
  Both facts hint that this is an early Type 2 driver.
- Technically, the drivers uses the FM/PSG drum setup. But the FM drum tracks play DAC sounds (using coordination flag EA) instead of FM notes.
- The code of the two DAC drivers matches exactly. The only difference between them is the DAC sound stored in Z80 RAM.
- Sound-related changes between Rev 00 and Rev 03:
  -> Rev 03 shortened the length of all DAC sounds by 1, because the DAC code keeps the sample that is read after the "length" counter reaches 0.
  -> Rev 03 changes the DAC playback delay from 02 to 01, probably because it matches 8000 Hz more accurately.
  -> DAC SFX 8A (third sound in bank 0C0000) was shortened by 4 bytes in Rev 03.
- The region check routine (00031E in Rev 00) prevents the game from booting on US consoles. (JP/EU is allowed)
  But unlike most other games, the game doesn't show an error message, but freezes with a black screen.
  (It enters an endless loop within the region check routine.)
  Only Perfect Edition shows an error message.
