0E40B4-15C2DF matches byte-by-byte between all June betas and the final.


DAC List Format:
The format is the same one as used in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 10EE [Sonic 3C] / 1116 [S&K])


Notes:
- PSG envelope 25h is 2 bytes shorter than it was in Sonic 3.
- Only the DAC sounds 81-9B and B2/B3 are present in vanilla S&K. All others point to the locked-on Sonic 3.
- The sample data of DAC sound B2/B3 is different from Sonic 3, even though length and sample rate are the same.
- A few songs use a global instrument table, but not all of them.
- The sound driver of all June betas matches the final one.
  The few differences in the May 25 driver are:
	- PAL Update Counter 1C04 is reset to 6 [offset 0051]
	- S&K-specific Music and DAC bank values are different due to the sound data being stored at different offsets.
	- The DAC bank for sounds B2/B3 point to the S3-part of the ROM. All other DAC sounds are the same.
	- After the SEGA sound is finished, the beta makes an additional call to zFillSoundQueue. [offset 1167]
	- PSG envelope 26h is 2 frames longer (like S3).
- The following songs differ between the May 25 beta and the final:
	09 Flying Battery 1 (same as Sonic 3, lacks S&K bugfix)
	1F Knuckles' Theme (same as Sonic 3)
	25 Title Screen
	2C Invincibility (same as Sonic 3)
	2F Level Select Screen (same as Sonic 3, lacks S&K bugfix)
	32 All Clear
	33 Staff Roll
- The sound drivers "Sonic 3C Beta 0408" and "Sonic 3C Beta 0517" match the one of vanilla Sonic 3 exactly. (except for 2 non-code bytes)
- The "S&K Beta 0525" sound driver is the same as final S&K, except for different bank values and an additional instruction in the Beta 0525.

Notes about Sonic 3C:
- The DAC sounds are exactly the same as in Sonic 3 in both Betas.
- The songs in S3C (April) are exactly the same as in Sonic 3 Final.
- Between the April and the May beta, these songs were changed:
	15 Sky Sanctuary (bugfix?)
	26 Staff Roll
- Between offset 265AA6 and 27FFFF, the S3C ROM from May 17 contains leftover data from the Sonic 2 ROM. (0E5AA6 .. 0FFFFF)


How the Speed Shoes work:
- Setting the byte at 1C08 speeds the music up. This is used by the Speed Shoes and done by updating the music multiple times a frame.
  In every frame, it does the speed shoe check this twice - once after updating the SFX tracks and once after updating the music tracks:
	if (1C2F > 0)
		1C2F --;
	else
	{
		1C2F = 1C08;
		UpdateMusicTracks();
	}
  So, the counter is processed up to 2-4 times every frame and the music can update up to 1-3 times per frame.
  The number of music updates per frame can be calculated using this formula:
	NumUpdates = ((val_1C08/2) + 1) / (val_1C08/2)
  or simplified:
	NumUpdates = (val_1C08 + 2) / val_1C08
- Example values:
	1C08	music updates per frame
	01	 3 / 1 = 3
	02	 4 / 2 = 2
	03	 5 / 3 = 1.6667
	04	 6 / 4 = 1.5
	05	 7 / 5 = 1.4
	06	 8 / 6 = 1.3333
	07	 9 / 7 = 1.2857
	08	10 / 8 = 1.25
	10h	18 /16 = 1.125
- When collecting speed shoes, the main game sets 1C08 to 08, i.e. 125% speed.
- The special stage speedup values are: 00h, 20h, 18h, 10h, 08h.
  The special stage move speed is located in 68k RAM at E444. 10h is default and gets incremented in steps of 04h until 20h is reached.
