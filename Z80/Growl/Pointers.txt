There is only 1 music bank: 018000


All song and envelope data of the ROM (018000-01B7A2) matches exactly between both versions of the ROM.
The Z80 sound driver matches, too.
There are some differences in SFX though.


Notes:
- The sound driver is a slightly modified version of the one used in Bonanza Bros.
- The SMPS driver has a modified PSG frequency table.
- The driver has the DoModulation bug fixed.
- Sound Test ID List: 002426
  Note: The Sound Test ID uses BCD encoding and due to that every 10 sound IDs are followed by a gap of 6 dummy values.
  The Sound Test IDs map to E1, 81..8F, 98..A2, A4..A6, A9
  The current Sound Test ID is stored at C024/25 (68k RAM)
- PlaySound routine: 001150
- Like Bonanza Bros., the sound driver is able to play DAC Voices using Sound IDs E4 and E5.
  The Sound IDs just play garbage though due to it being a leftover.
  The sound offsets are slightly different from Bonanza Bros., the other settings are identical.
