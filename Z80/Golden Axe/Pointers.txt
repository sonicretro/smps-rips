The sound data matches in all game versions (REV 00, REV 01 and REV 02 from Sega Smash Packs).


DAC Table
---------
The DAC voices are copied to the Z80 RAM at 0F00 before being played.
The sound driver then plays it using these values:

Start Offset = 0F08 (register HL)
Data Size = value at 0F00/0F01 (register DE)
Playback Rate = value at 0F06

Notes:
- The 68k routines that load the DAC voices are at 003CAC (voice 1) and 003CB4 (voice 2).
- The Playback Rate is copied to register D7, the start offset to D1.
- The routine always copies 09D0h bytes to offset 0F00.
- After it finished copying the DAC data, it writes the (hardcoded) Playback Rate to 0F06. (although this is redundant here)
- Although 09D0h bytes are copied, which is correct, the data size at 0F00 says 09C0, so the last 8 bytes of the DAC sounds are missed.


Data is DPCM compressed with the delta-array:
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FD FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 0DE8)


Notes:
- Like Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf, this is an early SMPS driver, which is somewhere between preSMPS Z80 and the final SMPS Z80.
  That means:
	- The sound trigger is at 1C04..1C07.
	- The Instrument Register order differs from the usual SMPS Z80:
	  B0 B4 40 48 44 4C 30 38 34 3C 50 58 54 5C 60 68 64 6C 70 78 74 7C 80 88 84 8C
- The DAC playback loop is similar to Bonanza Bros.
