Notes:
- The songs for Floor 10 and 30 contain conditional jumps for transitions into other songs.
  The transitions are one-directional only and were probably intended for falling through traps.
  Floor 30 -> Floor 10
  Floor 10 -> Floor 20
  Since that order doesn't really makes sense, that probably hints at a scrapped feature.
