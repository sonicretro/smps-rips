General Pointer List:	8000 (J) (Z80 Bank Offset)
Music Pointer List:	822E (J) (Z80 Bank Offset)
SFX Pointer List:	-- missing -- (original offset was maybe 1400, since this is what was written there)
Mod. Pointer List:	800E (J) (Z80 Bank Offset)
PSG Pointer List:	814C (J) (Z80 Bank Offset)
Z80 Snd Driver Offset:	-- missing --
DAC Drum Pointer List:	040000/048000 (J)


There is only 1 music bank: 058000


DAC List Format: (offsets are Big Endian!)
1 byte  - pitch
1 byte  - Pan (not 100% sure, because the 2nd DAC bank has 6Ah here)
2 bytes - unused
2 bytes - Data Length
2 bytes - Start Offset (relative to table, i.e. without Z80 Bank Bit)


Data is stored uncompressed, i.e. 8-bit LPCM.


Notes:
- The actual pointer list was partly overwritten with something.
- The SMPS musics are in SMPS Z80 Type 1 format, as proven by track 07. (which uses the commands FF05 and FF01)
- The whole ROM is actually data from the Earnest Evans ROM, offset 0A0000-0FFFFF.
- There is sound and DAC data for Earnest Evans at offset 040000/048000/050000.
