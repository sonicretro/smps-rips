Notes:
- The sound driver was stripped from everything related to music or PSG, probably to get space for the sound effects, which are all stored in the small Z80 RAM.
- The 510 beta still supports playing music and the Music List Pointer (at 1904) points to the only (empty) song. (PSG features were already removed)
- The 720 beta's code matches the final. There are some differences in the SFX data.
