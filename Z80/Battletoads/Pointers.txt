Notes:
- Right at the beginning of the songs there's an "EA aa bb" command.
  This sets up the YM2612 Timer A, which is used for timing. (affects both music and SFX speed)
  When Timer A expires, the V_INT interrupt routine is called manually to allow a higher range of timing.
- Music 0F..12 share the instruments.
