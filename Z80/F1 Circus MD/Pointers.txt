DAC List Format:
The format is the same one as used in Mazin Saga.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 0087)


Notes:
- The driver does automatic bank switching while loading the song.
  For songs 81-90 it switches to bank 070000. For songs 91-A0 it switches to bank 078000.
- The modulation envelopes are different in both banks. The volume envelopes, DAC drums and DAC voices match.
- Coordination Flag FF03 (Pause Music) has an additional check when resuming.
  It checks the Track Pointer and resumes the track only if it is nonzero.
- Song 05 had 6 FM tracks defined, but only 4 of them are loaded. The two unused tracks point to valid song data though.
