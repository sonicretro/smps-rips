Notes:
- This is the first game with a full SMPS Z80 Type 1 driver that was released.
  So like Ghostbusters it has some remains of preSMPS. Examples are the way envelopes are stopped and separate coord. flags for LFO Speed, the AMS and FMS amounts. (The code for FMS is there but unferenced, because of a custom coord. flag.)
