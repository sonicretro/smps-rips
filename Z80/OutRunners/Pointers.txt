General Pointer List:	N/A (everything is hardcoded into the driver)
Music Pointer List:	055114 (U) / 05695A (J) (Z80 Driver: 0D58)
SFX Pointer List:	N/A (there are only DAC SFX)
Mod. Pointer List:	N/A
PSG Pointer List:	054DF5 (U) / 05663B (J) (Z80 Driver: 0A39)
Z80 Snd Driver Offset:	0543BC (U) / 055C02 (J)
DAC Pointer List:	05501B (U) / 056861 (J) (Z80 Driver: 0C5E)
Sound RAM:		1C00 (Z80 RAM)


Music Pointer Format
--------------------
1 byte  - bank (00 - 1F0000, 01 - 1F80000)
2 bytes - song address (Z80 Bank Offset)

Thanks to the Sonic Retro for the music pointer list address and format.


DAC List Format: (all little endian values)
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Bank Offset)
2 bytes - Data Length
1 byte  - Bank (bits 22-15)
	Note: Before setting the bank, 30h is added to the bank value.
	      e.g. Bank 06 + 30 = 36 * 8000 = 1B0000

DAC Drum List:
At Z80 Offset 065F there's a lookup-table (with 0C bytes) for the DAC sounds used by the SMPS drum track.


Coordination Flags
------------------
This evil thing uses it own set of coordination flags. It's a "light" version of the usual SMPS command set.

Flag/Params	FlagCnv	Description
E0 pp		E0	Set Pan
E1 dd		E1	Set Detune (adds raw value to final frequency value)
E2 vv		E6	Change FM Volume
E3		E7	No Attack for next note
E4 ff		E8	Set Note Fill
E5 vv		EC	Change PSG Volume [points to same code as E6, but no song uses it]
E6 vv		EC	Change PSG Volume
E7 ii		EF	Set FM Instrument
E8 ww mm cc ss	F0	Modulation Setup
E9		F2	Track End
EA nn		F3	Set PSG Noise Mode
EB tt		F4	Set Modulation Type [has no effect, since it is never read back]
EC ii		F5	Set PSG Instrument
ED oooo		F6	Jump
EE ii tt oooo	F7	Repeat section (ii - Loop Index, tt - Loop Times, oooo - Jump Offset)
EF oooo		F8	GoSub
F0		F9	Return
F1 dd		FB	Change Transposition (makes notes higer or lower)
F2			sets 1C1C to 00 (1C1C contains the current song ID, so this marks the end of the song)
F3 dd		FF 00	Set Tempo

The Instrument Operator order follows the chip register order, i.e. it's the same Sonic 2 uses.


Notes:
- The driver completely ignores the DAC/FM and PSG track count and always assumes 5 DAC/FM tracks and 3 PSG tracks.
- There are no FM/PSG SFX. All SFX are DAC.
- A song is played by writing a number (01..29) to 1C00. The sound engine writes DAC drum sounds to 1C03.
- SFX are played by writing a number (01..2B) to 1C01 (1st channel) or 1C02 (2nd channel)
- The driver behaves like most SMPS 68k drivers and the FM instruments are stored in the same format as Sonic 2.
