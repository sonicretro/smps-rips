There is only 1 music bank: 038000


The sound-related part of the ROM (038000-03DFFF) matches exactly between J and U versions of the ROM.
The only exception is the byte at offset 0384D2, which is at offset 0022 in song 02.
It's part of a command that sets values for YM Timer A and B, so the value of Timer A differs.
This has no effect though, because music and SFX timing is done via Timer B only.


Notes:
- The unlicensed Arcade game "Top Shooter" (which runs on MegaDrive hardware) uses an exact copy of this sound driver.
- Song 05 has data for an unused FM channel. There are track headers for 5 FM channels while the header count is set to 4.
  The "extra channels" version sets the header count to 5 to enable the addition echo channel.
- The way the sound driver is initialized from the 68k is very similar to Magical Hat no Buttobi Turbo! Daibouken.
