General Pointer List:	8000 (J) (Z80 Bank Offset)
Music Pointer List:	8220 (J) (Z80 Bank Offset)
SFX Pointer List:	1F0250 / 1F825E (J)
Mod. Pointer List:	8012 (J) (Z80 Bank Offset)

DAC Drum Pointer List:	1F60B6 / 1FABFD (J)
DAC Voice Pointer List:	1F71BC / 1FBD03 (J)
Z80 Snd Driver Offset:	1BE000/1BF000 (J) (data of the two drivers matches exactly)
Pan Animation List:	0375 (Z80 RAM)
Sound RAM:		1C00 (Z80 RAM)


Each one of the 2 music banks (1F0000 and 1F8000) contains redundant copies of some general data like PSG envelopes, the instrument set, and pointers.
The first 0220h bytes match exactly in each bank. (except for the 3 pointers at 8006, 800E and 8010)
The data of the DAC sounds and sfx matches, too.


DAC List Format:
The format is the same one as used in Mazin Saga.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 0093)


Notes:
- The Z80 driver is very similar to the one used in Battletoads.
- Right at the beginning of the songs there's an "EA aa bb" command.
  This sets up the YM2612 Timer A, which is used for timing. (affects both music and SFX speed)
- The current bank is written to 1C00 by the 68k.
- It looks like everytime a song is played, the 68k copies the complete sound driver to the Z80 plus 8 bytes to 1C00.
  For bank 1F0000, it loads the Z80 driver from 1BE000 and initialization value from 0040CC.
  For bank 1F8000, it loads the Z80 driver from 1BF000 and initialization value from 0040D4.
- The Sound Test -> Z80 bank + song in bank table is located at 004216.
  Format is:
  1 byte - Bank
	00 - doesn't matter (doesn't change bank, for SFX)
	01 - Bank 1F0000
	02 - Bank 1F8000
  1 byte - sound ID for Z80
  
  The assignment is like this:
	01..16 - Bank == 01/02 (depending on what exists), sound ID 81..97 (89 is skipped)
	17 - Bank 02, sound ID 8C
	18 - Bank 02, sound ID 9F
	19 - Bank 02, sound ID 85
	1A+ - Bank 00, Sound ID A0..FD (F7-F9 and FB skipped)
