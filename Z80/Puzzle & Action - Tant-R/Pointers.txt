- Song -> Bank/Sound ID list: 038142 (music) / 0381C2 (SFX)
  Format:
    1 byte - Mode (00 - not banked, 01 - set music bank, 10 - set DAC bank)
    1 byte - Sound ID
    1 byte - Bank MSB
    1 byte - Bank LSB
- The PlaySound API is called via "TRAP #1". Parameters are passed via D0.
  Sound API Routine List: 038048
  The contents of D0 are:
	high word: internal Song/SFX ID
	low word: API Call (00 - Stop All Sound, 01 - Play Music, 02 - Stop Music, 03 - Play SFX)
  The internal IDs are converted to sound driver values using the table listed above by the routine at 03800C.
  The results are written to 68k RAM 9720-24 and transferred during VInt.
- The game plays (sound driver) Sound ID 81 to stop the music. That song also has the instruments for the FM drums.
- All songs define a header for 6 FM and 3 PSG tracks, even though none uses all of them. (Only 1 song uses PSG tracks at all.)
