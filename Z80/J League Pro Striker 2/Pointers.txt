DAC Table
---------
In every Z80 Bank with DAC sounds (068000h to 100000h), there are two tables:

At Z80 Offset 9000h (in every bank), there is a simple offset-list of 27h entries. Each offset is a 2-byte bank offset and points to an entry in the actual DAC Table.

The DAC Table starts at 9054h and has this format:

1 byte  - DAC sound played after end (00 - stop, 01-FF - continue with DAC sound xx)
1 byte  - DAC sound bank
2 bytes - sound data size
2 bytes - sound data start offset (bank-offset)
-> 6 bytes

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 13E1)


Notes:
- The volume tables are the same one as used in Chou Yakyuu Miracle Nine.
- The coordination flag set is the same as Chou Yakyuu Miracle Nine. (with minor differences implementation-wise)
- DAC sound 10 is present in every bank used by DAC sounds. The respective DAC Table entry also always points to the current bank for this sound.
