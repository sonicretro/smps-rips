DAC Table
---------
In every Z80 Bank with DAC sounds (198000h to 1F8000h), there are two tables:

At Z80 Offset 9000h (in every bank), there is a simple offset-list of 27h entries. Each offset is a 2-byte bank offset and points to an entry in the actual DAC Table.

The DAC Table starts at 904Eh and has this format:

1 byte  - Looping sound (00 - not looping, 01-FF - looping)
1 byte  - DAC sound bank
2 bytes - sound data size
2 bytes - sound data start offset (bank-offset)
-> 6 bytes

Note: The first sound is some stadium-noise and is in the background most of the time. Therefore it's present in every bank.
The sound bank byte of (only) this sound always points to the current bank.


Notes:
- The driver supports 2-channel mixing with volume control for each of the 2 channels.
  For volume control, every DAC bank has 10h volume lookup tables at offset 8000-8FFF.
  The volume tables cover -24 db (80xx) to +6 db (8Fxx), with increments in 2 db.
- The driver has a few additional Meta Coordination Flags.
    FF 07 xx - Reversed Note Timeout: stop note after (NoteLength - xx) frames
    FF 08 xx - Play sound xx on DAC channel 1
    FF 09 xx - Play sound xx on DAC channel 2
    FF 0A xx - Change volume of DAC channel 1 by xx
    FF 0B xx - Change volume of DAC channel 2 by xx
    FF 0C xx - Set volume of DAC channel 1 by xx
    FF 0D xx - Set volume of DAC channel 2 by xx
