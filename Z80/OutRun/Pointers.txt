The complete sound related part of the ROM (0F0000-0FFFFF) matches byte-by-byte in both, the normal and the [a1] version, except for some garbage data in areas of the [a1] version where the normal one has only FF bytes.


DAC List Format: (all little endian values)
2 bytes - Start Offset (Z80 Bank Offset)
2 bytes - Data Length
1 byte  - Pitch
1 byte  - Flags
          Bits 6-7: YM2612 Pan Register (can be C0, 40 or 80, all voices have C0)
          Bit   0:  Compression (0 - on/DPCM, 1 - off/PCM)

The format is the same one as used in Mazin Saga, except for the compression feature.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 0063)


Notes:
- Sound ID list:
	81-8A - Music (only 81-85 used)
	8B-8D - DAC Voices (note: sound ID is directly used as DAC drum index)
	8E-8F - crash (jumps to SFX routine, results in negative index)
	8E-9A - SFX
	9B-9F - crash (jumps to Special Command routine, results in negative index)
	A0-A3 - Special Commands
	A4-A8 - crash (Special Command routine reads beyond jump table)
	A9-FF - Stop All
- The sound driver uses YM2612 Timer A for timing.
  The frequency is set to 025A by the 68k CPU and never changed by the songs.
  This affects both, SFX and music timing.
