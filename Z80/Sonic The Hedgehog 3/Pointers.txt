DAC Drum Pointer List:	0F0000 [Note: There is only 1 bank of DAC sounds and thus no DAC Bank List.]

Z80 Snd Driver Offset:	0E0000

DAC List Format:
The format is the same one as used in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual delta-array.
00 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80 FF FE FC F8 F0 E0 C0 (Z80 Driver offset 10EE)


Notes:
- A few songs use a global instrument table, but not all of them.
- There is data for an unused and unreferenced DAC sound at 0F1584. This is between DAC sound AF/B0 and B1.


Prototype 1993-11-03 notes:
- It uses the tracks that would later be used in Sonic & Knuckles PC Collection.
- The sound driver lacks all of the Sonic-specific hacks and features. (fade in, music save states for 1up, music speed up, SFX patches, ...)
  However, they already started removing features from the stock SMPS Z80 Type 2 driver.
  Somehow it's very broken and PSG SFX sometimes gets stuck.
- Some coordination flags are different from the final version:
  E9 - apparently intended to be "Modulation Enable", but it's completely broken
  F1/F4 - sets the Modulation Envelope type (just like in every other SMPS driver) - but this version adds 1 to the index (not even S3 final does this)
          The only song that uses these commands is 27 Game Over. It uses command F4 with value FF in order to disable modulation.
  FC - dummied out (they removed pitch slide support already)
  FE - enable Special FM3 mode, this is not yet broken
- DAC sounds 81..9A are the same as in S3 final, but most of them aren't trimmed and have lots of 00 bytes in the beginning
  DAC sound 9B is a completely different snare drum
  The prototype has only 1 DAC bank.
- The SEGA chant sample is very muffled despite playing at a slightly higher sample rate than in the final.
- SFX are buggy due to a bank-switch bug in command F2 (stop track):
  In order to restore the music instrument, it switches to the music bank.
  But it never switches back to the SFX bank, so the next SFX track that is processed reads invalid data.
- PSG envelopes are the same in prototype and S3 final, except that S3 final has an additional one at the end.
  The modulation envelopes, which are sometimes used by PSG channels, are completely different.
