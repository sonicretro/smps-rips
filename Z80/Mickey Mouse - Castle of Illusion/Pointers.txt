Notes:
- The developers went crazy and didn't just remove and change many parts in the sound driver,
  but they also replaced the PSG volume envelopes with an ADSR system that reads instrument data in the format
  that is used by FM instruments and uses lookup tables to convert them to values that fit with the ADSR system.
- The instrument libary (used by all songs) is stored in a separate bank.
- The only difference between the J and U versions of song 0B is an additional Modulation command (F0) in the U version.
- Song 14 uses data from song 07.
- Song 10 uses data from song ??.
