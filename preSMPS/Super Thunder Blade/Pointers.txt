There is only 1 music bank: 078000

All sound-related data (07C000-07FFFF) matches exactly in the all versions.


Notes:
- This is one of the few preSMPS drivers that have PSG support.
  It is also the only known preSMPS driver to use only 20h bytes per track. All others have 30h-byte tracks.
- Sound Test Song List: 000C22
- All songs have headers for PSG tracks, even though none of the songs uses them.
- There is an unreferenced and empty song at 07C32E.
- The "Special FM 3 Mode" works differently to other SMPS drivers.
  If it is enabled, the notes have the following format:
    Special FM3 normal mode: n1 n2 dd
	n1 and n2 are converted to an FM frequency using the usual FM frequency LUT.
	The frequency of n1 is sent to register AD/A9 and AE/AA, the one of n2 is sent to AC/A8 and A6/A2.
	dd is the delay length.
    Special FM3 raw frequency mode: AD A9 AA AE A8 AC A2 A6 dd
        Ax are the raw frequency bytes sent to register Ax
        dd is the delay/length.
        It should be noted that the order of the first two bytes is reversed, compared to the rest.
