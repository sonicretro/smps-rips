Notes:
- Rent A Hero uses a similar version of preSMPS 68k/Type 2, so see there for more information.
- There is an unreferenced song at 0D3002. It's located between song 01 and 03.
  The music pointer list has song 02 point to song 0D instead. The game itself never plays it though.
  The song can be restored by writing value 0282 to offset 0D2CA4.
  The number of channels is incorrectly set to 9 while there are headers for only 6 tracks.
  In order to fix that, you need to change byte 0D3002 from 09 to 06.
- PlaySound routine: 0060A0
  This routine puts the sound ID stored in register D0 into the Sound Queue.
  The Sound Queue is an 8-byte buffer stored at C322-C329 (68k RAM). The number of used slots is stored at C320/21.
- Sound Test - current sound ID: C342/43 (68k RAM)
  Sound Test - song title pointers: 014BD8 (points to 2-byte Tile IDs, terminated with value FFFF)
  There seems to be an unused song title at 01513A.
- Title Screen - button C counter: C340/41 (68k RAM)
  Title Screen - Sound Test Check: 007FE2
- Game/Screen Mode: C400/01 (68k RAM)
- The 1991-05-28 prototype has only 17h songs, but song 02 is intact.
  Compared to the final version, there are minor differences in song 02 and 0E. Other songs are identical. (aside from moved pointers)
- FM instruments and envelopes (Modulation/PSG) match in the prototype and the final version.
  The prototype has DAC bank 03 and 25, which are missing in the final.
  The DAC table of DAC bank 24 (proto) is broken, but the DAC sound is identical to the final version.
  The DAC sound can be played at two speed values: 1E and 24 (final), 1E and 26 (proto).
