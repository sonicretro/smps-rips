Music Pointer/Len List Format:
4 bytes - ROM offset
4 bytes - Data Length - 1 (DBRA counter)


Note:
- This game is closely related to Darwin 4081. Everything sound-related is very similar - both on the Z80 and 68k side.
- The Z80 driver is the last entry in the Music Pointer/Len List. (entry 0Fh, ROM offset 01984A)
  The game copies 40h bytes more to the Z80 RAM when loading the driver than the table indicates.
- In order to play a song, the 68k copies some data from ROM into Z80 RAM, beginning with offset 1600. (routine at 0197A6)
  It writes song ID 81 to 68k RAM offset A22A, which is then copied to Z80 RAM offset 1C03. (routine at 0021C6)
  This makes the SMPS driver play the song.
- PlaySoundID: 01975A (plays ID stored at 68k RAM offset A22A)
- PlayStageBGM: 002192 (takes stage ID, stored at 68k RAM offset 802C/2D)
- Stage BGM list: 002246 (contains 3Ch values with 2 bytes each, value 00 is the first song)
- SFX list: 0051DA
- PlaySFX: 00522E (takes sound effect ID in register D0)
- The frequency table features slightly different values for the notes in each octave. Except for the first two values it's identical to Darwin 4081.
- The sound driver was stripped of PSG support and many other features like fading and half of all sequence commands.
  Unlike Darwin 4081, support for modulation envelopes was also removed.
- The SMPS volume command (F0) acts as a temporary volume change. Multiple F0 commands cause the volume to be changed by amount X in a consistent behaviour. (They sort of fixed it!)
  This makes it different from most other preSMPS Z80 drivers.
- Like Darwin 4081, commands EE Hold Lock and FC Pitch Slide require the parameter to be "-1" for enabling. All other preSMPS driver use "+1".
- As in Darwin 4081, the instrument format is a mess. The instruments set via sequence command EF are 19h bytes long and use the following operator array:
  B0 40 48 44 4C 30 38 34 3C 50 58 54 5C 60 68 64 6C 70 78 74 7C 80 88 84 8C (Z80 Driver offset 07AE)
  The FM drums on the other side, use the interleaved format commonly found in preSMPS drivers.
- The FM drums largely match Darwin 4081. Just pointers and the channel volume are diferent.
- Level BGMs are played using SMPS ID 81 (see code at 0021B0..0021D1), resulting in a song speed of FFh.
  The Game Over tune (song 02) is played using SMPS ID 88 (see code at 0027B6..0027CB), resulting in a song speed of 03h.
