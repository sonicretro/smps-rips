 repeat until you find Register 83, that's the terminator

There's additional code executed for Registers 83, B0, 40, 48, 44 and 4C. (see 0BB1B8)


Notes:
- Based on how it looks, I'd say this preSMPS driver is a Z80->68k port.
  The code looks terribly confusing at some places, all pointers are Little Endian and the base address matches with the beginning of a Z80 bank.
- The instrument format differs between the J and the UE version.
  The J version uses the format above, the UE version stores the registers in a separate array.

- All PSG-related features were stripped from the driver.
- The data for all songs is completely identical, except for a single command in song 02 and track pointers.
- In-sequence pointers (used by commands F6, F7 and F8) are relative like SMPS 68k but unlike preSMPS 68k Type 2.
- DAC panning is hardcoded into the SMPS sound driver. Since the DefDrum.txt lack support for something like this, I enforce proper panning via DAC.ini.
