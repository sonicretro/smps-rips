Notes:
- This is a Z80->68k port, similar to Phantasy Star II, and still has Little Endian pointers everywhere.
- Instrument registers in a separate array.
  B0 B4 30 38 34 3C 40 48 44 4C 50 58 54 5C 60 68 64 6C 70 78 74 7C 80 88 84 8C
- There seems to be an unreferenced PSG envelope at 010103.
- Unlike Phantasy Star II, this driver supports PSG channels.
  The DAC was reduced to a single function that plays a voice sample though.
- Parts of the chord mode (that was supported in Phantasy Star II) were stripped. There are leftovers of it at a few places though.
- The U version has an additional FM instrument added to the end of the table. The other instruments are identical.
- The SFX with ID A5 has an invalid pointer.
- Stage Music List: 002C60 (J) / 002C90 (U)
- The current stage ID is stored at F0B2/B3 (68k RAM).
- Song 0E/10 seems to be unused. I couldn't find any reference to it in the ROM at least.
