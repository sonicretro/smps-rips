018E00 to 03FFFF matches in Rev 02 and Rev 03 of World Championship Soccer.
03A000 to 03FFFF matches in all revisions.
019000 to 03FFFF in World Cup Italia 90 is 0D9000 to 0FFFFF in MegaGames 3in1 Vol 1. The data matches
except for a few absolute pointers, which have 03xxxx replaced with 0Fxxxx.


Notes:
- This is a Z80->68k port, similar to Phantasy Star II, and still has Little Endian pointers everywhere.
- Instrument registers in a separate array.

- The DAC driver of World Cup Italia 90 is a bit different than the one in the other versions.
  The DAC driver in WCI has 3 additional instructions to set 1FFD and 1FFA (Z80 RAM) to 0.
- DAC panning is hardcoded into the SMPS sound driver. Since the DefDrum.txt lack support for something like this, I enforce proper panning via DAC.ini.
- There is unreferenced instrument data at 03A50A-03AD83 that uses the interleaved register-data format.
- The DAC driver has a partial implementation of an "uninterruptable" flag using byte 1FFA.
  Since the Z80 code is unfinished (the only thing that works is resetting the flag), DAC commands are
  filtered out on the 68k side.
- There is unused an unused segment in song 04. (03C02B-03C042)
- 07 Game BGM 1 is the song played on the menu of MegaGames 3in1 Vol 1.
- The Pan Animation code is different from other preSMPS 68k Type 1 drivers and supports only a single type of animation.
- The Modulation Envelope code was fixed to do a proper sign-extention.
