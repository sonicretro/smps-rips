; Instrument Mode
;	DEFAULT - default SMPS registers (B0 30 38 34 3C 50 ... 8C 40 48 44 4C)
;	HARDWARE - hardware order for operators (B0 30 34 38 3C 50 ...)
;	CUSTOM - custom instrument definition, needs additional InsRegs setting
; 	INTERLEAVED - interleaved register/data format (for external instrument lib. only)
; The instrument library uses a custom table, the drum library requires the interleaved format.

; FM Channel Order
;	Here you can rearrange the 6 FM channels. You'll need this if FM drums use the Special FM3 mode.
;	Channels numbers are: 0..2 (FM 1..3), 4..6 (FM 4..6)
;	Note: The drum channel is (10 + FM channel).
;	Examples:
;		16 0 1 2 4 5 6 (default)
;		12 0 1 4 5 6 2 (commonly used from pre-SMPS Z80 to SMPS Z80 Type 1 with FM/PSG drums)
FMChnOrder = 12 0 1 4 5 6 2
;PSGChnOrder = 80 A0 C0

; Tempo Mode
;	TIMEOUT - used by preSMPS, SMPS Z80 Type 1 and most SMPS 68k
;	OVERFLOW - used by SMPS Z80 Type 2 and some late SMPS 68k
;	OVERFLOW2 - used by Sonic 2
TempoMode = Timeout

; Order of the execution of PlaySoundID and DoTempo
;	DOTEMPO - DoTempo is executed first, PlaySoundID then. So when a new song gets started, one DoTempo is missed.
;	PLAYMUSIC - PlaySoundID is executed first.
Tempo1Tick = PlayMusic

; FM Base Note
;	B - frequency table begins with a B note, so the table entry is (note - 80h) [SMPS 68k]
;	C - frequency table begins with a C note, so the table entry is (note - 81h) [SMPS Z80]
FMBaseNote = B
; FM Base Octave - usually 0, can be 1 if the FM tables begin with a 0Axx frequency
FMBaseOctave = 0
; Octave Wrap for Detune (caused by PitchSlide routine)
;	If enabled, frequencies <284h are moved to the next lower octave.
DetuneOctWrap = False

; prevent FM Note On from being sent when HOLD (SMPS Z80) or REST (SMPS 68k) flag is set.
NoteOnPrevent = Hold

; Note-Rest-Delay-Delay behaviour
;	RESET - a Rest resets the note frequency, so the 2nd Delay plays nothing [most SMPS 68k]
;	KEEP - a Rest keeps the note frequency, so the 2nd Delay replays the last Note [all SMPS Z80, some SMPS 68k]
DelayFreq = Reset

; Modulation Algorithm
;	can be 68K or Z80
ModAlgo = Z80

; Envelope Multiplier Mode
;	PRE - preSMPS 68k
;	68K - SMPS 68k
;	Z80 - SMPS Z80, preSMPS Z80
EnvMult = Z80

; Volume Mode
;	ALGO - the FM Algorithm/Connection setting defines the TL operators affected by the channel volume [SMPS 68k]
;	BIT7 - TL operators with Bit 7 set (value 80-FF) are affected by the channel volume [SMPS Z80]
VolMode = Algo

; Frequency values
;	Values can be decimal or hexadecimal (0xABC, $ABC or ABCh) and separates by spaces.
;	All numbers on the line are read until something invalid is found.
;	A multiline frequency list is possible by enclosing the block with curly brackets {}
;	Note: Due to how the parser works, there must be a space before the closing bracket.
;	
;	You can also use these default frequency values:
;	FMFreqs: DEF_68K, DEF_Z80
;	PSGFreqs: DEF_PRE (pre-SMPS), DEF_68K, DEF_Z80_T1, DEF_Z80_T2
; Note: Frequency 0A5F is actually not present in the driver (and FMBaseNote should be C),
;       but it is required for SMPSPlay's current Pitch Slide algorithm.
; Really a special frequency table.
