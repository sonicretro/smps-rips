Music Pointer/Len List Format:
4 bytes - ROM offset
4 bytes - Data Length - 1 (DBRA counter)


Note:
- The Z80 driver is the last entry in the Music Pointer/Len List. (entry 0Fh, ROM offset 009578)
- In order to play a song, the 68k copies some data from ROM into Z80 RAM, beginning with offset 1600. (routine at 008B6A)
  It writes song ID 81 to 68k RAM offset 1003, which is then copied to Z80 RAM offset 1C03. (routine at 0013F4)
  This makes the SMPS driver play the song.
- PlaySoundID: 008B42 (plays ID stored at 68k RAM offset 1003)
- PlayStageBGM: 001378 (takes stage ID, stored at 68k RAM offset 043E/3F)
- PlayBGMMain: 00138A (used by functions at 0013D0, 0013D6, ..., 0013EE)
- Stage BGM list: 0013B0 (value 00 is the first song)
  02 03 07 06 04 05 07 03 04 02 08 09 08 0A 09 0A 08 09 0A 08
- The frequency table is pretty special. Not only were the first two values were replaced with 00A5h and 0040h, but all other values are slightly different in every octave.
- The sound driver was stripped of PSG support and many other features like fading and half of all sequence commands.
- The SMPS volume command (F0) is even more buggy than in other versions.
  Fixing it (VOL_NN_FM in DefCFlag.txt) makes additional instruments appear in 01 Title Theme and 04 Gashalulu.
- EE Hold Lock and FC Pitch Slide require the parameter to be "-1" for enabling. All other preSMPS driver use "+1".
- Sound Test music play code: 000CAC
- The instrument format is a mess. The instruments set via sequence command EF are 19h bytes long and use the following operator array:
  B0 40 48 44 4C 30 38 34 3C 50 58 54 5C 60 68 64 6C 70 78 74 7C 80 88 84 8C (Z80 Driver offset 076D)
  The FM drums on the other side, use the interleaved format commonly found in preSMPS drivers.
