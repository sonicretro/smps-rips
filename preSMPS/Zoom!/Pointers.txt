Note:
- Unlike most preSMPS drivers, the Z80 ROM bank is not hardcoded. The Z80 driver reads it from RAM offset 1FFE/1FFF.
  The DAC ROM bank is stored at 1FFC/1FFD, but the values aren't used by the driver. (The DAC sounds are in the data bank.)
- The FM drums exactly match Tetris.
- All SMPS song headers (but song 0F) contain headers for 9 tracks. The unused PSG tracks 1-3 have their pointers set to values used by FM 1/2/4.
- There is an unused section for an echo track (of FM 1) in song 08. (ROM offset 039A59, file offset 01ED)
- The SMPS driver keeps disabling and reenabling the YM2612 timer. Because of that, the tempo is wrong (too slow) in older emulators.
  The tempo is right when the "Zoom" track is in sync with the stage intro animation.
- This preSMPS driver has a PCM sound playback routine. It plays DPCM sounds for sound commands AA-AD. Only AA and AB are valid though.
  The playback speed is controlled by the byte at 1FF7. (If the value is 00, speed is set to 01.)
  The 68k initializes the byte with 01.
- The way timing works in this driver is a bit special: The driver uses YM2612 Timer B set to 81 Hz, but it resets the timer's internal state *after* doing sound updates. This causes additional delays that slow the music down.
  Due to that, the stage intro animation, which was probably supposed to sync up with track 03 Zoom, finishes earlier than the track and cuts it short.
  In order to fix that and make the music play as intended, edit the Z80 driver at offset 00A0 (ROM offset0360A0) and change 60 to 6A.
- The preSMPS driver is mostly the same as the one used by Tetris.
- This is the first preSMPS driver that doesn't switch to Z80 bank C00000 before writing to the PSG chip.
- The DAC playback routine was reused in Bonanza Bros.
