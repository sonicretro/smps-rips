Notes:
- Rent A Hero uses a similar version of preSMPS 68k/Type 2, so see there for more information.
- There is a high amount of unused data - every song has PSG data that is dummied out by disabling the track.
  Even with all PSG tracks enabled, there is still unused data in song 02 at 078090-0780CC.
- A sound is played by writing ($8000 | ID) to C410/11. (68k RAM).
  During VInt, routine 000B78 will be move it to an internal sound queue (C322-C329) first (subroutine 000BA0)
  and later to the sound driver's "Sound ID" slot (F404).
  
  Sometimes the game also just calls the EnqueueSoundID routine at 008A2E directly.
- Sound Test ID list: 002988 (Note: ID 87 is missing)
- Sound Test Handler: 0028A0
- Song 07 seems unused. (There is no instruction MOVE.W #$8087, $C410.w.)
  It is also missing from the Sound Test ID list, so the only way to listen to it is hacking.
- There are 2 special coord. flags: E0 (drum mode enable) and E1 (drum mode disable)
  When a channel is in "drum mode" (Playback Bit 4 set), the sound driver loads a sequence for each note played.
  The note value is used as the sound ID to load.
  This is used to play drums (Sound ID 89-A2) on channel FM 5/FM 6.
