; The playback frequency is synchronized with the YM2612's Timer A,
; so it's effectively 53267 / x.
; The PCM routine can do up to 10 140 Hz.
; The DPCM routine can do up to 6 580 Hz.
BaseRate = 53267
RateDiv = 0.00

; 0 - delay by xx cycles
; 1 - add xx to tick value and process sample when overflowing

; DPCM sounds play with setting 0xFF (Timer A = 0x3FF, up to 53267 Hz)
; PCM sounds play with setting 0xF5 (Timer A = 0x3F6, up to 5326.7 Hz)
