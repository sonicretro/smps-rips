The sound-related data (010000-023FFF) matches exactly in all revisions.


DAC driver list format:
2 bytes - DAC driver size (Rev 00: in bytes, Rev 01/02: in 10h byte units)
4 bytes - DAC driver ROM offset


DAC drivers:
There's a seperate DAC driver for every larger sound.
(1) They load the start offset to HL at 0009, the sound length to BC at 000C and the playback rate to A at 000F.
(3) The code for HL/BC/A starts at 0068, 0076 and 0084. The byte at 017F decides between 3 different sound sizes, 03 = 0084 = longest.
(4) The code for HL/BC/A starts at 0068, 0076, 0084 and 0092. The byte at 017F decides between 4 different sound speeds (01 = high .. 04 = low).

The SMPS driver can play a DAC sound, too. The routine is at 11B4.
(11B4: HL = 11F3, 11B7: BC = 0268, 11BA: A = 40)


Note:
- When playing a larger sound, the current SMPS driver is unloaded and a DAC driver is loaded instead.
  Also the SMPS driver it reloaded everytime a new song is played.
- In Rev 01/02 they optimized the routine that copies bytes to the Z80 by unrolling the loop to copy 10h bytes per iteration.
- 68k routine offsets (for Rev 00):
    Copy pre-SMPS Z80 driver: 00494E (Rev 01: 00492E)
    Copy (generic) DAC driver: 004A24 (Rev 01: 004A1C)
    Play DAC sound: 0049F4 (Rev 01: 0049EC)
    Stop All Sounds: 0048F0
    Play Sound: 004AB2
    DAC Sound Handler: 0049A2
- BGM Resume Playlist: 0049E4
- The DAC Sound Handler plays the DAC voices and restores the BGM after they finish.
  Working variables (68k RAM):
    FE1A/1B - DAC Driver State
              0000 = not loaded (returns instantly)
              8xxx = request DAC sound playback 
                     -> copies driver from DAC driver list to Z80 RAM (first driver has ID 01)
                     -> copies requested DAC sound ID from FE1D (68k RAM) to 017F (Z80 RAM)
              0xxx = DAC sound playing
                     -> changes ID in FE1E according to BGM Resume Playlist
                     -> restores music driver when DAC sound finishes
    FE1C/1D - DAC sound ID to play (for loaded DAC driver)
