Notes:
- Rev 02 is sometimes also called "Rev A".
- This is a Z80->68k port, similar to Phantasy Star II, and still has Little Endian pointers everywhere.
- FM instruments are stored in an interleaved format. The order is: register, data, register, data, ...
  Register byte 83h terminates the instrument.
- The DAC driver is very similar to Phantasy Star II. The drums are also the same.
- DAC panning is hardcoded into the SMPS sound driver. Since the DefDrum.txt lack support for something like this, I enforce proper panning via DAC.ini.
- The song data matches exactly in both revisions. (with the exception of a few pointers in the track headers)
- Like Phantasy Star II, the songs make heavy use of the sound driver's Chord Mode.
- Rev 02 reduces the song volume to 1/4 by modifying a few instruments (volume / 16) and the "track volume" byte (volume * 4).
  The DAC driver also has two additional "SRA A" instructions to reduce the DAC volume to 1/4.
  The actual sequence data is the same in Rev 00 and Rev 02.
