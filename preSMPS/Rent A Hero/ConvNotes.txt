Conversion Notes:

Main Header:
	1 byte - Number of Tracks tc  ---> copy to 02h/03h
	9*tc bytes - Track Header (get copied to RAM)

Track Header:
00	playback_ctrl	[ignore]
			Bit 1 (02) is "at rest"
			Bit 2 (04) is "overridden"
			Bit 5 (20) is "pitch slide"
			Bit 6 (40) is "lock frequency" [PSG only] (prevents any frequency change)
			Bit 7 (80) is "active"
01	voice_control	[for channel sorting] (00-06 = FM, 16 = DAC, 80-C0 = PSG)
02	timing_divisor	[set global 04h]
			Bit 1 causes driver to double delays, everything else is ignored.
03-04	cur_pos		[channel init pos]
05	tranpose	[--> track header 02h]
06	modulation_type	
07	current_voice	[--> command EFh, has to be set again to have effect on FM channels]
08	vol		[--> track header 03h]

Automatically set:
09	stack_index	[set to 30]
0A-0B	note_timeout	[set to 0001]
0C-0D	frequency
0E-0F	last_note_time
10	slide frequency	if in "pitch slide" mode, it gets added to the frequency every frame
11	freq_flut_idx
13	psg_index
14	psg related	set to 1Fh to prevent further PSG processing
16	mod_freq_mult	multipler for modulation frequency
			Final NoteFreq = Note FNum + (ModFreq * FreqMult)
1C	fm algorithm
1D-20	TL level cache
21	pan_ams_fms	[--> command E0h]
22-2F	loop_stack_mem


Command List
------------
E0 - unused
E1 - unused
E2 - unused
E3 - unused
E4 xx - Change Tempo
	-> adds xx to the current tempo
E5 - Enable DAC
	-> sets Bit 4 in Trk+01h (Channel Bits)
E6 - Disable DAC
	-> clear Bit 4 in Trk+01h (Channel Bits)
	-> then disables the YM2612 DAC by writing Register 2B, Data 00
E7 - unused
E8 xx - locks (xx > 00) or unlocks (xx == 00) the PSG frequency (by setting Bit 6 in Trk+00h)
E9 xx - writes to Trk+13h, loads DAC data (pointers are at 0F5F8C), also forces resend of pan_ams_fms
EA xx - same as ED (SMPS files only use ED though)
EB xx - same as ED
EC xx - Change Volume
	-> adds xx to the volume
ED xx - xx gets doubled, if Trk+02h Bit 1 is set
	Then it gets written (as a word) to Trk+0Eh and Trk+0Ah.
	Finally, it returns instantly without processing more track data.
	-> This is effectively the same as "no attack".
EE - unused
EF xx - set instrument
	-> FM loads from the global instrument table
	-> DAC/PSG just return after setting the value
F0 xx - Set Volume to xx
F1 - unused
F2 - Stop Track
F3 xx - Set Noise Type (broken in Rent A Hero, because it does AND instead of OR)
	-> writes (xx | 0xE0) to the PSG chip and that's it
F4 tt - Set Modulation Type
F5 - unused
F6 xxxx - GoTo address
F7 ii cc xxxx - Loop cc times (slot ii) back to address xxxx
F8 xxxx - GoSub address
F9 - Return from GoSub
FA xx - set Tempo Divider
FB xx - Change Transposition
	-> adds xx to the track's transpose value
FC xx - disables (xx == 00) or enables (xx > 00) the Pitch Slide feature (by setting Bit 5 in Trk+00h)
	after every note command, there is a 1-byte signed frequency following that gets added to the current frequency every frame
FD - set pan_ams_fms to C0h (LR)
FE - set pan_ams_fms to 40h (R)
FF - set pan_ams_fms to 80h (L)

Addresses are Big Endian and relative to a constant value (driver base).
The coordination flags (and it seems the RAM locations, too) match with Metal Fangs.
Flag F3 is broken in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Beta, too.
