DAC sound list format:
2 bytes - DAC data size (DBRA iterations, so it's [byte size - 1])
4 bytes - DAC data ROM offset

The 68k copies the data to Z80 RAM, offset 0300.
The first 2 bytes copied (offset 0300/0301) are the DAC's size (for the Z80 driver).
The third byte (offset 0302) is the playback speed.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual preSMPS 68k delta-array:
01 03 06 0C 18 28 50 90 FF FD FA F4 E8 D8 B0 70 (Z80 Driver offset 00CD)


Notes:
- This is a Z80->68k port, similar to Phantasy Star II and Last Battle, and still has Little Endian pointers everywhere.
- Instrument registers in a separate array.
  B0 B4 30 38 34 3C 40 48 44 4C 50 58 54 5C 60 68 64 6C 70 78 74 7C 80 88 84 8C
- This seems to be a preSMPS 68k Type 1b driver, similar to Last Battle.
  But even though the sound driver allocates PSG channels, the UpdatePSGTrack function was removed.
  So this results in a sound driver that can do only FM.
- The sound driver was stripped from lots of stuff. 20 of the 32 coordination flags are dummied out.
- LoadDACSound routine: 002AB8 (register D0 contains the DAC sound ID to load)
- Half of the DAC sound sizes for the Z80 driver are a bit off.
  The ripped DACs contain the full data specified by the DAC Sound List.
- There is unused an unused segment in song 01. (039E88-039E91)
- Stage BGM Music List: 0047F0
- The game uses an insane nesting level for SMPS GoSub commands.
  The title song already uses 4 nested GoSubs + loops.
- The TrackRAM size was increased from 30h to 40h bytes. (probably to lessen the risk of GoSub/Loop commands breaking each other)
  Since loop memory starts at TrackRAM offset 22h, this makes 1Eh bytes of loop memory.
