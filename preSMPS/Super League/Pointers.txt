06C000 to 06C7B1 of the J version matches 06B000 to 06B7B1 of the W/U version. (envelope data, sequence headers)
06D4EA to 0703AB of the J version matches 06E4EA to 06F3AB of the W/U version, except for pointers. (sound driver code, sequence data)
06B000 to 07FFFF matches in the W and U versions.


DAC List Format:
Unlike Mahjong Cop Ryuu, the DAC list is not interleaved.
Instead, there are 2 separate lists, one containing all length values and another one containing all offsets.

The 68k copies the data to Z80 RAM, offset 0300.
The first 2 bytes copied (offset 0300/0301) are the DAC's size (for the Z80 driver).
The third byte (offset 0302) is the playback speed.

Data is DPCM compressed with the usual preSMPS 68k delta-array:
01 03 06 0C 18 28 50 90 FF FD FA F4 E8 D8 B0 70 (Z80 Driver offset 00CD)


Notes:
- This is a Z80->68k port, similar to Phantasy Star II, and still has Little Endian pointers everywhere.
- FM instruments are stored in an interleaved format. The order is: register, data, register, data, ...
  Register byte 83h terminates the instrument.
- The drum channel was dummied out by inserting an RTS instruction at the beginning, but else it's fully intact.
- Some instruments differ between the J and W/U release.
- The following songs share some data: 04/0D, 05/0E, 06/0F, 07/10
  also: 12/13/14/15 (empty songs)
- LoadDACSound routine: 008164 (J) / 0077D0 (W) / 007528 (U) (register D0 contains the DAC sound ID to load)
  For the W/U release, all of these voices were replaced.
- There are 2 additional LoadDAC routines with hardcoded offsets that load/play crowd noise.
	Sound	J	W	U
	Noise1	0080A0	00770C	007464
	Noise2	00811E	00778A	0074E2
- The DAC driver matches the one used in Last Battle/Hokuto no Ken and Mahjong Cop Ryuu, except for a few
  differences during initialization.
